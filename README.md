# Operataionalizing Machine Learning

This project is part of Nano degree program Machine Learning with Microsoft from Udacity. We created all the steps to create ML project with authentification , using the option of Auto ML microsoft provide us, Deployment and finding the best model , enable logging for reviewing details in the process, consume models endpoints and create and publish a pipeline , and last Documentation.

1) Authentication.- In this step we configuarte the authorization step but in this case we are using a udacity workspace. so We are skiping this part.

2) Auto ML model.- We are going to use the AutoML from Microsoft this give us the possibility to automatic find between many different algorithms and parameters to find the best model. 

3) Deploy the best model.-We are going to deploy the model found in the previous step to later cosume it.

4) Enable logging.- We are goint to enable the logging option to monitor the logs of the model

5) Documentation: We are going to document the model using the Swagger.

6) Consume model endpoints: We are going to consume the model .

7) Create and publish a pipeline: We are going to publish the application with the model to be used.
